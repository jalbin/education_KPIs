Overview
In this mini project you will dive into the world of SQL through creating and populating a database of your own and then extracting meaningful insights through SQL using queries and Python visualization techniques. You have the freedom to choose your own data, the sources it originates from, and the business case you wish to cater to.

Setup
In this Mini Project you will work in pairs, and are required to organize how to divide tasks throughout the week.

Brief
In this project, you’ll start by selecting and exploring datasets of your choice from various sources like Kaggle, APIs, or through web scraping, ensuring they complement each other for a cohesive analysis. You will then formulate hypotheses related to the datasets selected. The goal is to craft a narrative using the data, so ensure the datasets can be interconnected seamlessly. You’ll sketch out an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) highlighting significant data fields and relationships, then proceed to create and populate a functional database. During the process, you will carry out data wrangling to clean your datasets and prepare them for analysis. You will use SQL to run queries, derive valuable insights, and summarize your findings. To conclude, you’ll visualize the derived insights using Python libraries and compile a comprehensive report, encapsulating your data story from exploration to insights.
